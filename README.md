# Verifiable Credential Profile Template

This [GitHub Repository Template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) is designed to make profiling [Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/) for specific use cases as easy as possible.

The template comes preconfigured to support extensions such as [`@context`](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#contexts),  [credentialSchema](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#data-schemas) and [credentialStatus](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#status) to enable interoperability of vendor specific extensions to the core data model.

This template is designed to be served through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and can be further customized to support custom domain names, or themes.

Conformance tests are provided to ensure the profile remains valid as it is updated to support specific industry domains.

Example data is provided to convey intended use, and to support any hosted examples the profile might require for the sake of clarity to implementers.
